<p>Hello, plowsof here. They say never be the first to do something but here i am, experimenting with a new funding method.
The job market has deemed me unemployable (actually i dont know what they think as nobody replies to my applications)
so i've decided to "learn how to code" and "pull myself up by my bootstraps" after years of 'gigs' and contribute to the 
wonderful Monero community. I do not need to be brought before a panel of higher ups who discuss if i may be allowed to 
contribute. My work includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href='https://github.com/plowsof/monero-fund-watch'>General fund donation alert bot.</a></li>
<li>Additions to cryptogrampy's <a href='https://github.com/CryptoGrampy/android-termux-monero-node'>android-termux-node</a></li>
<li><a href='https://twitter.com/xmr_radio/status/1435638499995226117'>Blockheight alerts</a> for XMR.radio + <a href='https://xmr.radio/funding'>funding page design</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
And my latest project which i am seeking funding for 'wishlist-as-a-service'. I've already created it and added new features such as auto sub address and QRcode creation. and its being used
by 3 projects already so which makes me proud to improve the Monero ecosystem (it's like how netflix releases the entire series at once so you can binge watch).</p>

<p>Hopefully this is a success, and plants the seed for other freelance devs!, and before you crucify me for accepting BTC, this is to attract all kinds of developers who don't mind what they're paid in. I've also added a 'usd' value, incase you decide to empty the pot and convert to a stable coin for stability.</p>
